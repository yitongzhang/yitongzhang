### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I'm Yitong, a designer in San Francisco. I grew up in Montreal, Canada â€“ a very cold place my family moved to when I was young. I currently work at Coinbase, where I've had the priviledge of designing and redesigning much of the consumer app, as well as establishing the design system.
