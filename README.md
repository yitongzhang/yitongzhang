### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yitong, a designer in San Francisco. I grew up in Montreal, Canada â€“ a very cold place my family moved to when I was young. Immigration is a big part of my story. 

I currently work at Coinbase. Since I've been here for a while, I have had the priviledge to design a bunch of the consumer app, as well as the design system.

In my spare time, I like to work on small projects , make pottery, and tend to my beautiful vegetable garden.
